# Analysis of Original Video Data of Ayalon Road

## Gathering data

The data was gathered when I lived in a tower near a major interval of *Ayalon Road* (around *Hashalom* interchange).

Orignially, it was intended to use a dedicated webcam to take photos of the road for a full month with frequency of ~1s, processing them in realtime, and only saving abstract data (e.g. identifiers and locations of vehicles).
However, this would require a dedicated webcam, more challenging realtime processing, and a rush development before I left the appartment.

Instead, it was decided to use Galaxy S8+ Hyperlapse mode with x8 speed, FHD resolution and standard configuration elsewise.
A simple magnet-based stand was kindly provided and located on the appartment's glass-wall by the colleage and friend Oded Shimon.
It turns out that an 8-minutes video taken this way (compressed into 1 minute) requires ~120MB of storage
(or equivalently 100 videos = 13 hours = 12GB).
This does not allow to record the road for 24-7, yet permits a reasonable cover of the road in various dates and hours over a month,
as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/ido90/AyalonRoad/edit/master/Ayalon/Photographer/VideosTimes.ipynb).
