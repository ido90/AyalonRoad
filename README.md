# Analysis of Original Video Data of Ayalon Road

## Gathering data

The data was gathered when I lived in a tower near a major interval of ***Ayalon Road*** in Tel-Aviv (around *Hashalom* interchange).

Orignially, it was intended to use a dedicated webcam to take photos of the road for a full month with frequency of ~1s, processing them in realtime, and only saving abstract data (e.g. identifiers and locations of vehicles).
However, this would require a dedicated webcam, more challenging realtime processing, and a rush development before I left the appartment.

Instead, it was decided to use **Galaxy S8+ Hyperlapse mode with x8 speed, FHD resolution and standard configuration elsewise**.
A simple magnet-based stand was kindly provided and located on the appartment's glass-wall by the colleage and friend Oded Shimon.
It turns out that an 8-minutes video taken this way (compressed into 1 minute) requires ~120MB of storage.
This does not allow to record the road for 24-7, yet permits a reasonable cover of the road in various dates and hours.

**[This](https://github.com/ido90/AyalonRoad/blob/master/photographer/VideosTimes.ipynb) notebook** summarizes the cover of dates and times by **80 recorded videos (~14 hours and 13 GB in total)** over a month and a half.
